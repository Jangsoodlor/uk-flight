# UK Flight
A program to compute and show statistics of flight routes from the United Kingdom to anywhere in the world. It shows how to go from city A to city B via Air. And check whether a direct flight exists. If not, find the route to city C where the passenger can transfer the flight to city B. As well as statistics on the punctuality of airlines. Users will be able to compare the cancellation rate and average delay of airlines, the delay time distribution, and see the correlation between average delays of this year and the previous year.
